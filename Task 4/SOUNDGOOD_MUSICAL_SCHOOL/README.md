## Introduction

Welcome to the project folder for IV1351. This is in collaboration with Michel Dib https://github.com/MichellDib

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies.
